# Lyric Export script for Aegisub

Export for both the simple LRC as well as enhanced LRC format available.

## Installation

* Requires [Aegisub](https://aegisub.org) (duh)
* Check [their Documentation](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/automation/manager/) where to install scripts

## Usage

### Simple LRC

Simply time the lines accordingly. Line-End times are not required as they are not used for the export.

An introduction to timing can be found here:
[Timing subtitles to audio](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/timing/)

### Enhanced LRC

Time the lines, including line end times. They are required to time the last word/syllable correctly.
After that, you can time words or individual syllables in Karaoke mode.

You can find an introduction to Karaoke timing here:
[Karaoke Timing Tutorial](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/karaoke_timing_tutorial/)

### Export

After you're done timing, select `Automation` > `LRC` > `Export File - eLRC/LRC`, depending on your timing.
Karaoke-timed lyrics can be exported as both simple LRC or enhanced LRC.
